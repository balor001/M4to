m4to
M4to was a student project where a goal was to create a game, and realese it to the world. 
Our game is primarly built to work on android devices

Android APK: https://m4to.itch.io/m4to

This game is currently on the Google Play store and Itch.io. With the Itch.io front being more polished.
This is a very simple game, where it works like the classic Nokia matopeli or Snake games. You collect food and the worm grows.
Wer created multiple levels for this project, Oiva Kytönmäki was our 3D artist and me Aleksi Oravainen And Joonas Lapinleimu were the coders.
